# Explaining the counter application



When we create a new project in VSCode, Flutter will create a counter application, which is an application that has a floating action button. When you click it, it will increase the text number in the center of the app.





For now, let's start to discover this app, and modify it.

 1. Open the emulator.

    > Note: we explained before how to run the application on emulator “03 run the Application”.



2. After you open the emulator, Run the app

   > Note: check step 5, “03 run the Application”.



3. You will see the counter application. Try to press the Floating button, you will see that the number will increase ^_^.
