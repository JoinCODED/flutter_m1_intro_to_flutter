# main method



2. We will type the "**main method**" and "**runApp function**", and in future lessons, we will understand what does it mean **method** and **function**. Right now, just type this method inside the **main.dart** file. Flutter will need these codes to build our App.



```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```
