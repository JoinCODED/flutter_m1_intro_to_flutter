When we created a new Flutter app project, Flutter will create and generate some files and folders that will help us to build Flutter App as you see in. In the future, we will get understand and deal with some of these files and folders. Right now, we will deal with the first folder called "lib".



#### **lib folder**

This folder will contain all our dart files; files that end with the ".dart" file format, and we will deal with this folder a lot. As you see in (Figure #1.1.1), our lib folder has "main.dart" file.



#### **main.dart file**

This most important file, flutter will need it to build our App, and we should not change its name, and this file should be at the root of the **lib** folder.





#### **Let's start :)**

​	1. First, we will open the **main.dart** file and we will remove all the codes inside it.
